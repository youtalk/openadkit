Open AD Kit is the first [SOAFEE](https://www.soafee.io/) blueprint for deploying [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) as containerized, cloud/edge-ready software-defined vehicle components.

This repository provides the component images, deployment configurations, a
versioned runtime bundle, and CI metadata needed to run and ship Autoware-based
stacks more predictably.

## Quickstart

Install the latest release on Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/latest/download/openadkit \
  | bash -s -- install
# Add the launcher to this shell if the installer reported ~/.local/bin is missing.
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
openadkit setup --verify
# Start a new login session if setup changed Docker group membership.
openadkit run planning-simulation
```

Or work from a source checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit.git
cd openadkit
./openadkit setup --verify
# Start a new login session if setup changed Docker group membership.
./openadkit run planning-simulation
```

Open the noVNC visualizer at `https://localhost:6080/vnc.html` (password: `openadkit`; accept the self-signed certificate warning).

The same entry point ships in the version-matched release bundle and in source
checkouts. It prepares deployment data, pulls missing images, starts the stack,
and verifies readiness. For install options, manual checksum verification,
runtime controls, and other deployments, see the
[documentation site](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/).

## Deployments

The manifest-driven CLI and release bundle support these curated deployments:

- **[planning-simulation](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/planning-simulation/)** - Run planning with a simulator-backed vehicle interface
- **[logging-simulation](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/logging-simulation/)** - Replay sample data through the logging/perception stack
- **[scenario-simulation](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/scenario-simulation/)** - Run scenario-based simulation workflows
- **[carla-simulation](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/carla-simulation/)** - Connect Autoware to CARLA simulation (Humble, amd64, GPU)

The source checkout also contains a standalone Zenoh deployment:

- **[zenoh-bridge](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/openadkit/deployments/zenoh-bridge/)** - Bridge isolated edge and visualization ROS domains in one Compose project

## Images and Releases

Images are published to GitHub Container Registry.
