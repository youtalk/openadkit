# CARLA Interface

The `carla-interface` image packages `autoware_carla_interface`, translating
Autoware control commands to CARLA and CARLA sensor data to ROS 2 messages.

!!! note "Platform support"
    The image is published for amd64 on Humble and Jazzy. The CARLA *deployment*
    is Humble-only. The bridge itself does not require a GPU, but the complete
    CARLA deployment needs an NVIDIA GPU for the CARLA server **and** defaults
    to the amd64 `sensing-perception-cuda` Autoware image for perception.

It provides:

- CARLA world initialization and synchronous simulation
- Ego vehicle spawning and sensor-kit configuration
- Camera, LiDAR, IMU, and GNSS message translation
- Vehicle command calibration
- Traffic light state publication
- Lightweight sensor mappings for constrained hosts
- Launch file: `autoware_carla_interface.launch.xml`

See the [CARLA Simulation deployment](../deployments/carla-simulation/index.md)
for `openadkit run carla-simulation --gpu`.
