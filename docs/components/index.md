# Components

Open AD Kit is a component-based project designed to run on a variety of platforms with containerized services. Each **Autoware function** remains independently deployable, while the published images group closely related functions together to keep the runtime layout simpler.

## Architecture Overview

Autoware uses a **Core / Universe** architecture. **Core** contains rigorously reviewed base functionality required for safe autonomous driving. **Universe** contains community extensions and research features that build on the Core foundation. Open AD Kit packages Universe components into focused container images that can be composed into complete AD systems.

## Build Pipeline

--8<-- "includes/build-pipeline.md"

`universe-common` is an Open AD Kit-owned thin intermediate built on top of the
upstream `autoware:core-devel`/`base` images. The bake groups and build commands
are documented in [Build from Source](../development/build-from-source.md).

## Interface Layers

Autoware defines three formal interface categories that govern how components communicate:

<div class="oak-component-grid">

<div class="oak-component-item">
<strong>AD API</strong>
<span>External interface for fleet management and HMI. Exposed as ROS 2 services and topics for vehicle state queries and commands; external gateways (e.g. HTTP/MQTT) can be layered on top.</span>
</div>

<div class="oak-component-item">
<strong>Component Interface</strong>
<span>Internal inter-module communication via ROS 2 topics and services. Standardized message types ensure compatibility across components.</span>
</div>

<div class="oak-component-item">
<strong>Local Interface</strong>
<span>Intra-component communication within a single image. Implementation details that do not cross component boundaries.</span>
</div>

</div>

## Image Reference

The published component images and their platforms. This table is generated from
the image catalog (`.github/image-inventory.json`), so it always matches what CI
builds. See [Container Images & Versioning](../getting-started/container-images.md) for the tag
naming scheme.
