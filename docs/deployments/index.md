# Deployments

A **deployment** is a running instance of Open AD Kit, a specific combination of Autoware components configured to achieve a particular task, such as a simulation or a full autonomous driving stack.

Runnable Compose assets live under `deployments/<name>/` in the repository.
Each directory has a short README that points here for the full guide.

Start curated samples with the CLI:

```bash
./openadkit list
./openadkit run planning-simulation
```

Shared base: `deployments/base/` (`docker-compose.yaml` + `runtime.env` for
container ROS/DDS). Each deployment has one complete `config.env`. The CLI
passes it to Compose; you do not need to invoke `docker compose` directly.

`runtime.env` is loaded by services via `env_file:`; `config.env` is loaded by
Compose via `--env-file`.

Fetch maps/rosbags with `./openadkit fetch <name>` or `./openadkit run <name>`
(see [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md)). Zenoh is a standalone
demo: fetch `scenario-simulation`, then use `cloud.sh` / `edge.sh`.

## Samples

Recommended for **learning and development**.

- [CARLA Simulation](samples/carla-simulation/index.md) — `deployments/carla-simulation/`
- [Planning Simulation](samples/planning-simulation/index.md) — `deployments/planning-simulation/`
- [Scenario Simulation](samples/scenario-simulation/index.md) — `deployments/scenario-simulation/`
- [Logging Simulation](samples/logging-simulation/index.md) — `deployments/logging-simulation/`

## Demos

Use-case specific topologies.

- [Zenoh Bridge](demos/zenoh-bridge/index.md) — `deployments/zenoh-bridge/` (edge/cloud remote viz + teleop)
