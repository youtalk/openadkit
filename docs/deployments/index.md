# Deployment

A deployment combines Open AD Kit images, environment files, and Docker Compose
configuration for a specific task.

| Deployment | Purpose | Topology | GPU |
|------------|---------|----------|-----|
| [Planning Simulation](planning-simulation/index.md) | Plan and follow a route on a demo map | Single host | No |
| [Scenario Simulation](scenario-simulation/index.md) | Execute predefined traffic scenarios | Single host | No |
| [Logging Simulation](logging-simulation/index.md) | Replay sensor data through sensing, perception, and localization | Single host | Recommended |
| [CARLA Simulation](carla-simulation/index.md) | Drive a CARLA ego vehicle in closed loop | Single host | Required |
| [Zenoh Bridge](zenoh-bridge/index.md) | Separate edge compute from visualization and control | Single Compose project | Varies |

New users should start with Planning Simulation. The CLI and release bundle
support Planning, Scenario, Logging, and CARLA Simulation. Zenoh remains a
standalone source-checkout deployment.

## Base and Overlay Model

Planning, Scenario, Logging, and CARLA Simulation include the shared
`deployments/base/docker-compose.yaml`. The base defines map-check, map,
planning, vehicle, system, control, API, and visualizer services. Planning and
scenario overlays add the dummy simulator; each deployment adds only its delta.

Each curated deployment carries a `deployment.json` manifest and one complete
`config.env` for Compose interpolation.

```bash
openadkit list
openadkit validate planning-simulation
openadkit run planning-simulation
openadkit status planning-simulation
openadkit logs planning-simulation --follow
openadkit stop planning-simulation
```

Add `--ros-distro jazzy` to select Jazzy; Humble is the default. CARLA is
Humble-only and requires `--gpu`. The release bundle vendors the curated
deployments and shared base. Local settings belong in ignored
`config.local.env`; release component images remain pinned. The base's
`runtime.env` is loaded inside containers via `env_file:`.

Zenoh does not have a runtime manifest. Use its source-checkout launcher
scripts documented on its deployment page.

See [Custom Deployment](custom-deployment.md) to compose a different stack and
[Container Images & Versioning](../getting-started/container-images.md) for tag
selection.
