## Prerequisites

- **Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) or 24.04 (Noble)** with `sudo` access
- `curl` for the release installer; `python3` and `tar` are preinstalled on supported Ubuntu releases
- A web browser - the visualizer runs in it, no display server needed

## 1. Get Open AD Kit {: #get-open-ad-kit }

--8<-- "includes/first-release-note.md"

=== "Source checkout"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit.git
    cd openadkit
    ```

=== "Release bundle"

    Download the latest release. The command verifies the release bundle before
    installing it to `~/.local/share/openadkit` and makes `openadkit` available
    from `~/.local/bin`.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/latest/download/openadkit \
      | bash -s -- install
    ```

    If `~/.local/bin` is not on your `PATH`, the installer prints the command to
    add it. For a reproducible install, replace `latest` with a release version
    and pass the same version to `install`:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/openadkit \
      | bash -s -- install --version vX.Y.Z
    ```

    To inspect the bundle before running anything, download and verify it
    manually against the release metadata:

    ```bash
    VERSION=$(curl -fsSL \
      https://api.github.com/repos/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/latest \
      | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["tag_name"])')
    curl -fLO "https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/download/${VERSION}/openadkit-${VERSION}.tar.gz"
    curl -fLO "https://github.com/autowarefoundation/openadkit/releases/download/${VERSION}/release-metadata.json"
    EXPECTED=$(python3 -c 'import json; print(json.load(open("release-metadata.json"))["bundles"][0]["sha256"])')
    printf '%s  %s\n' "$EXPECTED" "openadkit-${VERSION}.tar.gz" | sha256sum --check -
    tar -xzf "openadkit-${VERSION}.tar.gz"
    cd "openadkit-${VERSION}"
    ```

    The extracted bundle is the same runtime; run it with `./openadkit` from the
    extracted directory.

The release bundle contains only the runtime entry point and deployment assets.
A source checkout also contains `components/`, CI, tests, and development tools.

## 2. Set Up the Host {: #set-up-the-host }

After a release install, these commands work from any directory. For a source
checkout, prefix them with `./` (for example `./openadkit`) and run them from
the repository root.

```bash
openadkit setup --verify
```

Run setup as your normal user. It requests `sudo` only for host changes. CPU is
the default; add `--gpu` for NVIDIA deployments. `--gpu` also installs NVIDIA
OpenGL/Vulkan libraries needed for CARLA.

--8<-- "includes/docker-group-activation.md"

## 3. Run Planning Simulation {: #run-planning-simulation }

```bash
openadkit run planning-simulation
```

Add `--ros-distro jazzy` to select Jazzy. Humble is the default in both source
checkouts and release bundles.

`run` downloads and verifies the sample map, pulls missing images, waits for
Compose readiness, and verifies the running deployment. A verification failure
leaves the containers running so their logs remain available.

## 4. Open the Visualizer {: #open-the-visualizer }

Wait about 10 seconds for the containers to initialize, then open:

```text
https://localhost:6080/vnc.html
```

Use the default password **`openadkit`** and accept the self-signed certificate.

For a remote host, keep noVNC loopback-only and forward it over SSH:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:6080 <user>@<host>
```

Then open `https://localhost:8080/vnc.html` locally.

## 5. Drive {: #drive }

In RViz2, follow the [Autoware planning simulation instructions](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/demos/planning-sim/lane-driving/#2-set-an-initial-pose-for-the-ego-vehicle) to:

1. Set an **initial pose** for the ego vehicle
2. Set a **goal pose** on the map
3. Watch the vehicle plan and drive the route

## Upgrading

An installed release upgrades to the latest stable version with:

```bash
openadkit upgrade
```

The new release is verified, installed alongside the old one, and the
`openadkit` launcher is repointed. The previous version is kept in the install
destination (by default `~/.local/share/openadkit/`), so you can roll back:

```bash
openadkit install --version vOLD --force
```

`--force` replaces the kept version directory. To switch to a version that is
not installed, omit `--force`. Source checkouts update with `git pull` or
`git checkout` instead.

## Runtime Controls

```bash
openadkit status planning-simulation
openadkit logs planning-simulation --follow
openadkit stop planning-simulation
```

Use `deployments/<name>/config.local.env` for host-specific settings. Source
checkouts also accept component image overrides there; release component refs
remain pinned by the release context. The file is ignored by Git.

For source builds and local image development, use the separate
[Build from Source](../development/build-from-source.md) workflow.

If something goes wrong, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
