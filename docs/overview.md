# Overview

<p class="oak-hero-lead">
  What Open AD Kit is, why it exists, and how it relates to Autoware — the autonomous driving stack it packages for cloud-native deployment.
</p>

## What is Open AD Kit

Open AD Kit packages the [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) autonomous driving stack as a set of focused, independently deployable container images. Rather than shipping one monolithic image, it splits the stack along the AD pipeline — sensing, perception, localization, mapping, planning, control, API, simulation, visualization, and CARLA bridge services — so you can run only what a given workload needs.

Autoware provides the autonomy stack; Open AD Kit makes it deployable. It packages upstream software into composable container images, defines deployment configurations, integrates with target platforms and vehicle systems, and maintains the build, test, and release tooling needed to run consistently from simulation through in-vehicle deployment.

## How It Works

Open AD Kit runs Autoware as a pipeline of containerized components. Each container handles one stage of autonomous driving, and the stages communicate over ROS 2 DDS on the host network:

Single-host deployments bind CycloneDDS to loopback by default. Set
`CYCLONEDDS_NETWORK_INTERFACE` to an exact LAN or VPN interface name only when
cross-host DDS is required. `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` separates domains but does not
provide authentication or encryption.

1. [**Sensing**](components/sensing-perception.md) captures and preprocesses raw sensor data (LiDAR, camera, IMU).
2. [**Perception**](components/sensing-perception.md) detects and tracks objects, traffic lights, and drivable space.
3. [**Mapping**](components/localization-mapping.md) serves high-definition map data that the rest of the stack consumes.
4. [**Localization**](components/localization-mapping.md) determines the vehicle's exact position on the map.
5. [**Planning**](components/planning-control.md) computes a safe, feasible trajectory to the goal.
6. [**Control**](components/planning-control.md) converts that trajectory into throttle, brake, and steering commands.
7. [**Vehicle System**](components/vehicle-system.md) bridges those commands to the actual vehicle or simulator.

A **deployment** combines the shared base services with task-specific overlays. Planning and Scenario Simulation add a dummy simulator on top of the base; Logging Simulation adds sensing, perception, and localization for recorded sensor data.
