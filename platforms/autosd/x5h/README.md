# AutoSD on R-Car X5H (Strategy A: BSP kernel + AutoSD userspace)

Non-ostree AutoSD 10 rootfs for the R-Car X5H (`r8a78000` / `ironhide`) board,
booted with the unmodified Renesas BSP kernel 6.1.102 over the existing netboot
path (TFTP kernel + NFS root). Validated off-board first by a QEMU gate that
boots the rootfs under a **BSP-constraint-mimic kernel** — a 6.1.y LTS kernel
carrying the same feature gaps as the BSP kernel (no SELinux, no ext4 security
xattrs, no nftables, no erofs) — so every container-runtime question is
answered before board time.

## Folder Structure

- `aib/`: automotive-image-builder manifest (distro `autosd10-sig`, package mode)
- `config/`: containers.conf drop-in shipped into the image
- `kernel/`: mimic-kernel config fragment + build script (QEMU gate only, never for the board)
- `scripts/`: QEMU gate harness and board staging/smoke scripts
- `uboot/`: `bootcmd_autosd` template (site values are filled at session time, not committed)

## QEMU gate semantics

The gate boots the rootfs export under the BSP-constraint-mimic kernel in
QEMU, logs in as root, runs `scripts/gate-guest.sh` inside the guest, and
judges the run by grepping the session log for a fixed set of markers.
`gate-guest.sh` emits the markers; `qemu-gate.exp` judges them by string
match — the two must stay in exact sync.

`gate-guest.sh` never exits nonzero mid-way: every assertion prints a marker
and `GATE_DONE` always prints, no matter which gates failed. All judgement
happens on the host side (`qemu-gate.exp`), by grepping the captured log for
these markers.

Marker vocabulary (greppable, consumed by CI and quoted in the Confluence
results page):

| Marker | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `GATE1_LOGIN_OK` | Guest login succeeded. |
| `GATE1_SYSTEMD_STATE=<state>` | `systemctl is-system-running` output, informational. **`degraded` is expected** on this gate/kernel combination — see the Troubleshooting row for the two specific units that account for it. |
| `GATE2_STORE_FS=<fstype>` | Filesystem podman's store actually sat on for the GATE2 probe (expected `ext4`, since GATE2 mounts nothing). Informational — recorded so a reader can see what the GATE2 verdict was measured against, not gated on. |
| `GATE2_EXT4_FAIL_OK` | Podman image load on the ext4 root either failed outright with an unsupported-xattr error, or `load` reported success but a follow-up `getcap` inside a running container did not find the capability — either way, the capability did not survive onto ext4, confirming the `EXT4_FS_SECURITY` blocker. |
| `GATE2_EXT4_FAIL_OTHER` | Podman image load on the ext4 root failed for an unrelated reason. |
| `GATE2_EXT4_UNEXPECTED_PASS` | Podman image load on the ext4 root succeeded **and** the capability was confirmed readable via `getcap` inside a running container — a verified pass, not just a `load` that happened to exit 0 (see the GATE2/GATE3/GATE4 asymmetry row in Troubleshooting for why the `getcap` step matters here). |
| `GATE3_STORE_FS=<fstype>` | Filesystem podman's store actually sat on for the GATE3 probe. **Required to equal `tmpfs`** — otherwise a silently-failed tmpfs mount could fall through to the ext4 root underneath and still print `GATE3_TMPFS_OK` for the wrong reason. |
| `GATE3_TMPFS_OK` | Podman container store on tmpfs works, including the capability xattr round-trip. |
| `GATE3_FAIL` | The tmpfs-store probe failed. Not part of the pass path; printed instead of `GATE3_TMPFS_OK` so a human reading the raw log sees why that marker is missing. |
| `GATE4_STORE_FS=<fstype>` | Filesystem podman's store actually sat on for the GATE4 probe. **Required to equal `btrfs`**, for the same reason as GATE3's. |
| `GATE4_BTRFS_OK` | Podman container store on a btrfs-formatted second disk works. |
| `GATE4_FAIL` | The btrfs-store probe failed. Not part of the pass path; printed instead of `GATE4_BTRFS_OK`, same rationale as `GATE3_FAIL`. |
| `GATE5_IPTABLES_OK` | Container networking works via GATE5's first attempt (a port-published container), whatever firewall driver was in effect when it ran. **Not expected to fire** under the currently-shipped `firewall_driver = "none"` (see the netavark row in Troubleshooting) — kept in the vocabulary in case a future config change makes the first attempt viable again; `GATE5_NONE_OK` is the expected outcome today. |
| `GATE5_NONE_OK` | Container networking works with the `firewall_driver = "none"` fallback (direct container IP, no port publishing). This is the expected outcome with the config as currently shipped. |
| `GATE5_FAIL` | Neither the port-published attempt nor the none-fallback produced working networking. |
| `GATE_DONE` | `gate-guest.sh` reached the end of its run. |

Two markers are deliberately **either/or**, not single-verdict:

- **GATE2 accepts either verdict.** `GATE2_EXT4_FAIL_OK` confirms the xattr
  blocker the survey predicted; `GATE2_EXT4_UNEXPECTED_PASS` is a legitimate
  finding that would simplify the board plan. `GATE2_EXT4_FAIL_OTHER` — an
  unrelated failure — matches neither accepted pattern and therefore fails
  the gate. That is deliberate: it means the ext4-store assumption broke for
  a reason the plan did not anticipate, and that needs a human to look at it.
- **GATE5 accepts either** a port-published container working (whatever
  driver is in effect) or the `firewall_driver = "none"` fallback with a
  direct container IP. `GATE5_FAIL` means neither path produced working
  container networking. `50-x5h.conf` ships `firewall_driver = "none"`
  directly (see the netavark row in Troubleshooting for why), so GATE5's
  first attempt is not expected to succeed and `GATE5_NONE_OK` is the normal
  outcome; the first attempt is still run every time, so a regression in it
  becoming viable would show up as `GATE5_IPTABLES_OK` instead, and a
  regression in the `none` fallback itself still shows up as `GATE5_FAIL` —
  GATE5's own two-stage structure keeps probing real behavior either way,
  independent of what is shipped as the starting default. The fallback
  drop-in (`99-gate-fallback.conf`) that path writes is removed again at the
  end of GATE5 regardless of outcome, since Task 8 copies `gate-guest.sh`
  onto the board's persistent NFS root and a leftover drop-in there would
  silently shadow Task 2's `50-x5h.conf` for good; which path was taken is
  already on the record via the `GATE5_*` marker itself.

`GATE3_STORE_FS=tmpfs` and `GATE4_STORE_FS=btrfs` exist because GATE3/GATE4's
mount step (`mount -t tmpfs …` / `mkfs.btrfs` + `mount /dev/vdb …`) checks no
exit status and `gate-guest.sh` never aborts on a failed mount — without this
check, a silently-failed mount would leave `/var/lib/containers` on whatever
was mounted there before (typically the ext4 root), and the podman probe that
follows would still validly pass or fail, just against the wrong filesystem,
printing a `GATE3_TMPFS_OK` / `GATE4_BTRFS_OK` that didn't actually exercise
tmpfs/btrfs at all.

The overall gate (`qemu-gate.exp`) exits 0 only if `GATE1_LOGIN_OK`,
`GATE3_TMPFS_OK`, `GATE3_STORE_FS=tmpfs`, `GATE4_BTRFS_OK`,
`GATE4_STORE_FS=btrfs`, `GATE_DONE`, one of the GATE2 accepted markers, and
one of the GATE5 accepted markers are all present in the session log.

`qemu-gate.exp` waits for the guest-side run with an inactivity timeout (15
minutes with no new `GATE<n>_…` marker line, re-armed on every marker) rather
than one fixed budget for the whole run: the run's total length varies with
TCG emulation speed and isn't a meaningful thing to cap as a single number,
but a guest that goes genuinely silent, or dies outright, still fails fast
with a clear diagnostic instead of a generic "gate did not finish". The
15-minute figure is not arbitrary: GATE5 is the longest stretch with no
re-arming marker output (every command in it is output-suppressed), and its
two 30-iteration poll loops alone cap at 210s each — 420s of pure
network/sleep wall-clock — before accounting for podman process-spawn
overhead on top. See the comment at `qemu-gate.exp`'s `inactivity_timeout`
declaration for the full arithmetic; it is coupled to GATE5's poll bounds in
`gate-guest.sh`, not an independent number.

## Gate verdict: survey §7 answers

The table below is the observed output of the first fully green QEMU gate run
([`30730519760`](https://github.com/youtalk/openadkit/actions/runs/30730519760),
branch `feat/autosd-x5h-rootfs`), not a restatement of what was expected.
Every row traces to a marker or a console line from that run; where a claim
is inference rather than direct observation, it says so.

The `*_STORE_FS` markers are what make findings 2-4 trustworthy, not
incidental — they prove each verdict was actually measured on the filesystem
its name claims, not on whatever `/var/lib/containers` happened to still be
mounted if an earlier `mount`/`mkfs` had silently failed. Without them this
table would be a set of assertions; with them it is a set of measurements.

| §7 question | Marker(s) observed | Observed result | Survey §7 answer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Does AutoSD 10 userspace boot on a kernel with `selinux=0`? | `GATE1_LOGIN_OK`, `GATE1_SYSTEMD_STATE=degraded` | Login succeeded. `systemctl is-system-running` reported `degraded`, from exactly two failed units (`selinux-bools.service`, `ukiboot-set-success.service` — see Troubleshooting for both). | **Yes.** AutoSD 10 userspace boots and is usable on a kernel with no SELinux. `degraded` is expected and benign here, not a fault — both failing units are already named and explained in Troubleshooting so the board operator is not alarmed by seeing it. |
| 2. Does podman's default container store carry the `security.capability` xattr on ext4 without `EXT4_FS_SECURITY`? | `GATE2_STORE_FS=ext4`, `GATE2_EXT4_FAIL_OK` | Measured on ext4 (`GATE2_STORE_FS` confirms it — no mount is performed for GATE2, so this is the root export's own filesystem). `podman load` succeeded, but a follow-up `getcap` inside a running container did not find the capability. | **No** — the default container store on ext4 without `EXT4_FS_SECURITY` cannot carry `security.capability`, so it is unusable as shipped; the board needs an alternative store (findings 3-4). **This verdict was wrong once already, and the reason is worth more than the verdict itself:** the previous CI cycle reported `GATE2_EXT4_UNEXPECTED_PASS` — a false positive, because `podman load` alone exits 0 even when the xattr is silently dropped. Only after GATE2 was given the same `run` + `getcap` confirmation GATE3/GATE4 already had did this, the real answer, emerge. A load-only check is not sufficient evidence for this question on this filesystem; treat any future variant of this probe that skips the `getcap` step with the same suspicion. |
| 3. Does a tmpfs-backed container store work? | `GATE3_STORE_FS=tmpfs`, `GATE3_TMPFS_OK` | Measured on tmpfs (`GATE3_STORE_FS` confirms it, guarding against a silently-failed mount leaving the probe on the ext4 root underneath). `podman load` + `getcap` in a running container both succeeded — the capability round-trips. | **Yes.** tmpfs carries the capability xattr correctly. It is volatile — RAM-backed, gone on reboot — so it is useful as a scratch/ephemeral store, not as the board's primary persistent one. |
| 4. Does a btrfs-backed container store on a second disk work? | `GATE4_STORE_FS=btrfs`, `GATE4_BTRFS_OK` | Measured on btrfs (`GATE4_STORE_FS` confirms it — the blank second QEMU disk, `mkfs.btrfs -f` then mounted). `podman load` + `getcap` both succeeded. | **Yes**, and it is the *only* viable **persistent** option on this board: the BSP kernel has `# CONFIG_XFS_FS is not set` and `# CONFIG_F2FS_FS is not set`, and ext4 is ruled out by finding 2 above. This is exactly what makes the EPEL 10 `btrfs-progs`/`gdisk` dependency (first Troubleshooting row) non-negotiable, not a convenience choice. |
| 5. Does container networking (netavark) work without `NF_TABLES`? | `GATE5_NONE_OK` | Container networking worked with `firewall_driver = "none"`: a direct-container-IP HTTP request succeeded, which is that marker's own pass condition. (The `podman0` bridge coming up and `veth0` entering forwarding were directly observed in console output from the prior cycle, under this same, unchanged `gate-guest.sh` GATE5 logic — noted here as corroborating detail, not re-observed verbatim in this specific run's log excerpt.) | **Yes, with `firewall_driver = "none"`** — not with `"iptables"`, which is not something a future reader should retry: netavark 2.0.0 (what this image resolves) removed that backend outright, a hard config-validation rejection independent of any kernel capability (see the netavark Troubleshooting row for the version check). **Not yet confirmed, and flagged rather than assumed:** this proves networking works with `firewall_driver = "none"` on the *mimic* kernel only. The board runs the real BSP kernel with `x_tables` modules loaded from the copied module tree — a different kernel, a different module set, the same shipped config. Whether container networking also works there is what the board session still has to confirm; it is not established by this gate. |

The gate itself consumed roughly 430 s of guest-visible wall clock, under
same-arch TCG with no `/dev/kvm` on the CI runner — comfortably inside
`qemu-gate.exp`'s 900 s inactivity budget (see above). That budget was tuned
from desk arithmetic before any gate had ever run end to end; this is the
first real timing signal for it, and it confirms the budget is sound —
retiring that open risk.

## Running locally

The same gate CI ran can be replayed on an x86 dev host, from the CI
artifacts, without rebuilding anything. Two reasons this is worth doing
beyond interactive debugging: it is the only place the tar → ext4
reassembly gets exercised outside CI, and that reassembly is exactly what
`scripts/stage-nfs-rootfs.sh` does for the board's NFS root (`tar xf
<tarball> -C <dest-dir>`) — so a green local replay is corroborating
evidence for the board staging path, not just a debugging convenience. It
also leaves a local copy of `x5h-rootfs.tar` on disk, which is what
`stage-nfs-rootfs.sh` consumes at board time.

Host tools: `gh` (authenticated), `qemu-system-aarch64` (Debian/Ubuntu:
package `qemu-system-arm`), `expect`, and `e2fsprogs` for `mkfs.ext4` — the
same set CI's "Install host tools" step installs, minus the pieces only
needed to build the image and test containers from scratch.

Everything through downloading and unpacking the artifact runs as your own
user. Loop-mounting the ext4 export and running `qemu-gate.exp` need root —
those two commands below are prefixed `sudo` and are the only ones that are.

```bash
cd platforms/autosd/x5h

# 1. Download the bundle from the most recent green run on this branch (at
#    the time this was written, that resolves to 30730519760, the same run
#    cited in "Gate verdict" above).
gh run download --repo youtalk/openadkit -n x5h-gate-bundle -D /tmp/x5h-bundle \
  "$(gh run list --repo youtalk/openadkit --workflow autosd-x5h-rootfs.yaml \
       --branch feat/autosd-x5h-rootfs --status success --limit 1 \
       --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')"

# 2. See what's actually there. The workflow stages a flat bundle before
#    upload (one `testimages/` subdirectory, everything else at the top
#    level) — `find` rather than a fixed path or a `**` glob, both because
#    that's more robust and because it matches how the two lookups below
#    already have to work:
#      Image  x5h-rootfs.tar  x5h-gate.log  testimages/busybox-oci.tar  testimages/captest-docker.tar
#    There is no ext4 export in the bundle — it's reproducible and large,
#    so rebuild it from the tar below, the same way the CI workflow's own
#    "Derive the ext4 export from the tar" step does.
find /tmp/x5h-bundle -type f

# 3. Rebuild the ext4 export from the tar. truncate/mkfs need no privilege
#    (they operate on a plain file); the loop mount does.
truncate -s 6G /tmp/x5h-replay.ext4
mkfs.ext4 -q /tmp/x5h-replay.ext4
mnt="$(mktemp -d)"
sudo mount -o loop /tmp/x5h-replay.ext4 "$mnt"
# --xattrs: mirrors the CI step exactly. A plain `tar xf` silently drops
# extended attributes on extract (exit 0, no warning), which would make
# GATE2 fail for the wrong reason (the archive never carried
# security.capability into the export) instead of the real one
# (EXT4_FS_SECURITY missing in the mimic kernel).
sudo tar --xattrs --xattrs-include='*.*' \
  -xf "$(find /tmp/x5h-bundle -name x5h-rootfs.tar)" -C "$mnt"
sudo umount "$mnt"
rmdir "$mnt"

# 4. Inject the test payload. Use the script, not a hand-copy: besides the
#    two test tars and gate-guest.sh, it also neutralizes /etc/fstab
#    (preserving the original as fstab.image) — skip that and the guest
#    reboot-loops on the stock fstab's ESP entry (see Troubleshooting).
./scripts/inject-test-images.sh /tmp/x5h-replay.ext4 \
  "$(dirname "$(find /tmp/x5h-bundle -name busybox-oci.tar)")"

# 5. Run the gate. On this x86 host, run-qemu-gate.sh's aarch64+/dev/kvm
#    check is always false, so this is cross-arch TCG — materially slower
#    than CI's same-arch TCG (~430 s of guest time in run 30730519760, per
#    "Gate verdict" above). There is no verified local number for cross-arch
#    TCG; expect it to run considerably longer and budget accordingly rather
#    than trusting a specific figure. qemu-gate.exp's inactivity timeout
#    re-arms on every marker, so a slow-but-progressing run will not be
#    killed early.
sudo ./scripts/qemu-gate.exp ./scripts/run-qemu-gate.sh \
  "$(find /tmp/x5h-bundle -name Image)" /tmp/x5h-replay.ext4 \
  /tmp/x5h-blank.img /tmp/x5h-local-gate.log

# 6. Read the result the same way CI's "Show gate markers" step does.
grep -E 'GATE[0-9_]+' /tmp/x5h-local-gate.log
```

`qemu-gate.exp` itself exits 0 only once every required marker from the
vocabulary table above is present in the log (`GATE1_LOGIN_OK`, both
`GATE3`/`GATE4` `_STORE_FS=`/`_OK` pairs, `GATE_DONE`, one of the two
accepted GATE2 verdicts, one of the two accepted GATE5 verdicts) — check
`echo $?` after it returns, or just compare the `grep` output above against
the marker table and the "Gate verdict" table for the expected line-for-line
match.

## Board bring-up

Board time is scarce and one-shot — no rerun scheduled. The order below encodes the plan's
board-safety invariants; do not reorder it.

### 1. Stage the AutoSD NFS root

The CI workflow uploads a flat artifact bundle, not a nested one, so find the tarball rather
than assuming a fixed path:

```bash
find /tmp/x5h-bundle -name x5h-rootfs.tar
```

Then, as root on the NFS server host:

```bash
scripts/stage-nfs-rootfs.sh <x5h-rootfs.tar> <bsp-rootfs-dir> <dest-dir> <testimages-dir>
```

`<bsp-rootfs-dir>` is the existing BSP NFS root — it is only ever read from (to copy
`/lib/modules/6.1.102-yocto-standard`, since overlayfs/veth/bridge/x_tables are all `=m` on
the BSP kernel), never modified. `<testimages-dir>` is the directory holding
`busybox-oci.tar` and `captest-docker.tar` — with the flat CI bundle, that is the same
bundle directory `find` located above.

The script refuses to run if `<dest-dir>` already exists, and prints `OK: staged at
<dest-dir>` plus a `<dest-dir>/.x5h-stage-complete` stamp file on success. If a previous run
was interrupted, `<dest-dir>` can exist without that stamp — treat that as incomplete, not
resumable: `rm -rf <dest-dir>` and rerun the script from scratch. Once staged, add the new
export to `/etc/exports` (mirror the existing BSP export line's options) and run
`exportfs -ra`.

### 2. U-Boot: `printenv` backup, then `bootcmd_autosd`

Before touching the U-Boot environment, capture a full `printenv` to the session log — this
is what makes the next step reversible. The default `bootcmd` is **never** modified; only a
new `bootcmd_autosd` variable is added, from the `uboot/autosd-boot.env` template.

The template's `${...}` placeholders are of two kinds: `serverip`, `kernel_addr_r`, and
`fdt_addr_r` are already defined by this board's U-Boot environment (built-ins); the rest
(`autosd_export_path`, `bootargs_bsp`, `board_ip_config`, `dtb_file`) are operator-supplied
from `x5h-work/HANDOFF.md` (not committed to this repo) and must all be `setenv` at the
prompt **before the first line of the template**, not merely before `bootargs_autosd` —
`autosd_export_path` is consumed by the *first* line (`autosd_nfsroot`), which is unquoted
and therefore expands immediately, exactly like the double-quoted `bootargs_autosd` line
that follows it. Setting `autosd_export_path` only after `autosd_nfsroot` has already run
still bakes an empty export path into it (`nfsroot=<ip>:,vers=3,tcp`), and that string is
plausible enough to pass a casual glance. After entering all three lines, read back
`printenv autosd_nfsroot bootargs_autosd` and check that the export path and the `ip=`
config are actually present in the output — not just that the strings "look complete" —
then boot the AutoSD NFS root with:

```
run bootcmd_autosd
```

Once logged in, `systemctl is-system-running` reporting `degraded` is expected, not a fault
— the QEMU gate reproduces the identical state from exactly two known-benign failed units
(`selinux-bools.service`: no SELinux in this kernel; `ukiboot-set-success.service`: no
ukibootctl partition, since this image ships `use_efipart: false` — see the Troubleshooting
table below for both). Neither should be chased as a live problem.

At the end of the session, re-verify the unmodified BSP boot path still works (power cycle,
default `bootcmd`, BSP NFS root) before releasing the board.

### 3. On-board podman smoke: tmpfs before btrfs

`scripts/board-podman-smoke.sh` is staged onto the NFS root under `/var/lib/autosd-test/`
by step 1. It runs in two phases, and the order is an enforced invariant, not just a
documented one: `btrfs` refuses to run unless a `tmpfs` run has already passed on this boot.

```bash
board-podman-smoke.sh tmpfs                                        # zero board mutation
board-podman-smoke.sh btrfs /dev/disk/by-partlabel/autosd-store     # writes the LUN
```

A genuine `tmpfs` pass stamps `/run/x5h-smoke-tmpfs-passed` before printing
`SMOKE_tmpfs_PASS`; `btrfs` checks for that stamp before touching anything and prints
`SMOKE_btrfs_TMPFS_GATE_FAIL` and exits if it is missing. The stamp lands in `/run` and
nowhere else because this boot has no initrd — U-Boot loads only `Image` and the DTB, so PID
1 mounts `/run` itself as an API tmpfs — which is what makes the interlock genuinely
boot-scoped: it is cleared by a power cycle, not merely by an `rm`. (If `/run` were ever
*not* a mount here, the stamp would instead land on the NFS server's copy of the export and
would survive power cycles and sessions, silently pre-authorizing a `btrfs` write on a cold
boot — so this is worth re-confirming if the boot path ever changes.) A failed unmount at the
end of a `tmpfs` run withholds the stamp even though `SMOKE_tmpfs_PASS` still prints (the
podman/network result it reports is genuine; only the "board left clean" promise the stamp
makes is at stake) — its own `SMOKE_tmpfs_UMOUNT_WARN` marker says so. If you deliberately
need to run `btrfs` alone — e.g. after a reboot cleared the stamp but you already know
`tmpfs` is fine — either re-run `tmpfs` again (it costs nothing) or
`touch /run/x5h-smoke-tmpfs-passed` by hand to override.

Each phase prints `SMOKE_<mode>_STORE_FS=<fstype>` right after its mount succeeds (mirroring
`gate-guest.sh`'s `GATE3_STORE_FS`/`GATE4_STORE_FS`) — check it reads `tmpfs` / `btrfs`
respectively, not whatever was mounted underneath, before trusting a later `_PASS`. Every run
ends in one of: `SMOKE_<mode>_PASS`; `SMOKE_<mode>_FAIL` (a podman or network check failed);
`SMOKE_<mode>_MODPROBE_FAIL`; `SMOKE_<mode>_MOUNT_FAIL`; or, `btrfs` only,
`SMOKE_<mode>_DEV_FAIL` (bad block device) or `SMOKE_<mode>_TMPFS_GATE_FAIL` (no prior
`tmpfs` pass) — except an invalid or missing mode argument, which prints a plain
`usage: ...` line and exits 2 with **no** `SMOKE_` marker at all, since the script hasn't
chosen a `$MODE` to prefix one with yet. Grep for the full set; if you see none of them, the
run stopped before producing anything trustworthy — treat that the same as a failure, not as
a pass.

`btrfs` is the only step in this task that writes to physical storage — the previously-empty
32 GB UFS LUN. Partitioning that LUN (creating the GPT label) and formatting it
(`mkfs.btrfs -f <partition>`) are both deliberate manual, eyes-on steps done at the board
prompt itself, not by this script: the point where the operator confirms by hand that the
device names the right disk before anything is written to it. `sgdisk` (partitioning) and
`mkfs.btrfs` come from an EPEL 10 repo the image manifest adds — the AutoSD 10 repos alone
do not carry `btrfs-progs`/`gdisk`.

Site values — server IP, export paths, the `ip=` kernel argument, and the DTB filename —
live in `x5h-work/HANDOFF.md` on the operator's machine and are never committed to this
repo.

## Troubleshooting

(findings recorded as discovered)

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aib build` fails during depsolve with `No match for argument: btrfs-progs`, `No match for argument: gdisk` (`osbuild.solver.exceptions.MarkingError: ... missing packages: btrfs-progs, gdisk`) | Both packages were moved out of the AutoSD 10 / CentOS Stream 10 repos upstream and are not present in `baseos`, `appstream`, `automotive`, `autosd`, or `compose`. btrfs is the only viable persistent container store on the X5H's BSP kernel (no `CONFIG_XFS_FS`, no `CONFIG_F2FS_FS`, ext4 has no security xattrs), so `btrfs-progs` is not optional; `gdisk` partitions the board's UFS LUN for it. (The plan's Task 2 note predicted `iptables-nft` would need the same treatment — it did not: `iptables-nft` resolves fine from the existing repos.) | Added EPEL 10 as an `extra_repos` entry in `aib/vars.yml` (`id: epel10`, `baseurl: https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/10/Everything/aarch64/`, `gpgcheck: false`). `gpgcheck: false` is deliberate: EPEL is signed with its own key, not the CentOS Stream 10 / Red Hat 10 keys aib trusts globally via `distro_gpg_keys`, and aib's repo schema has no per-repo `gpgkey` field to add a second trusted key just for this repo. |
| `aib build` gets through depsolve and RPM install, then fails on the `add_files` copy: `org.osbuild.copy: ... cp: cannot create regular file '/run/osbuild/tree/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/50-x5h.conf': No such file or directory` | `org.osbuild.copy` (what `add_files` compiles down to) does not create parent directories, and nothing else in the pipeline creates `/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/` — `/etc` itself exists (aib's `init_rootfs_dirs_stage` creates it), but not this subtree. aib does have logic that auto-creates parent directories for `add_files` (`_ensure_parent_directory` in `aib/simple.py`), but it only fires on the glob/path-preserving code path and is never reached for an explicit `source_path` → `path` pair like ours. | Added a `make_dirs` entry for `/etc/containers/containers.conf.d` (`parents: true`, `exist_ok: true`) to `aib/x5h-rootfs.aib.yml` — the same shape `_ensure_parent_directory` itself constructs, aib's own idiom for this. Confirmed from `files/simple.mpp.yml`'s `rootfs` pipeline that the `org.osbuild.mkdir` stage `make_dirs` generates runs strictly before the `org.osbuild.copy` stage `add_files` feeds (mkdir is stage index 4, copy is stage index 6, and osbuild runs a pipeline's stages in the order the manifest lists them), so the directory exists by the time the copy runs. **Do not instead move the drop-in to `/usr/share/containers/containers.conf.d/`** — that path is not one of the documented `containers.conf` search paths (`/usr/share/containers/containers.conf`, `/etc/containers/containers.conf`, `/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/*.conf`, per `containers.conf(5)`); the build would go green and the drop-in would silently never apply, so GATE5 would fall back to `firewall_driver="none"` for a reason unrelated to the missing `NF_TABLES` the gate is actually there to probe — a wrong finding on the exact question this gate exists to answer. |
| The build succeeds and the gate boots, but never reaches a login prompt; the console shows a repeating cycle of `Timed out waiting for device dev-d…SP.device - /dev/disk/by-label/ESP.` → `Dependency failed for boot-efi.mount` → `Dependency failed for local-fs.target` → `Starting emergency.service - Emergency Shell Override - Reboot...` → `systemd-shutdown[1]: Syncing filesystems and block devices.`, and `qemu-gate.exp` eventually fails with `FATAL: no login prompt within 1800s` (or, after the boot-loop guard below, `FATAL: guest rebooted N times without reaching a login prompt`) | **Not fstab** (an earlier fix neutralized fstab, which was necessary but not sufficient — the cycle continued). aib itself generates and installs an *enabled* `boot-efi.mount` unit into the image (`computed-vars.ipp.yml` copies it to `/usr/lib/systemd/system/boot-efi.mount`, requiring `What=/dev/disk/by-label/ESP`, and adds it to `image_enabled_services`), gated by `use_efipart_mount`/`use_efipart`. Neither the bare ext4 export nor the board's NFS root has an ESP partition, so this unit times out (30 s), `local-fs.target` fails, and AutoSD's `emergency.service` — **"Emergency Shell Override - Reboot"** — reboots the guest instead of dropping to a shell. Forever: 37 reboots were observed in one CI run before the harness's fixed budget ran out. Because this unit ships *inside the rootfs* (not something the gate scripts add), it is not gate-specific — it would have hit the board's NFS-root boot too, over serial, in the one-shot session with the operator present. (`selinux-bools.service` also fails in the same console output, right next to this cycle — see the next row; it is not the cause of the loop and should not be conflated with it.) | Set `use_efipart: false` in `aib/vars.yml`. `computed-vars.ipp.yml` only computes `use_efipart` from `use_ukiboot` "if not already in locals()", so a `--define-file` override wins and `use_efipart_mount` (an unconditional `mpp-eval: use_efipart`) follows it to `false`, which stops `boot-efi.mount` from being generated or enabled at all. Every reference to the EFI partition/device (`build.ipp.yml`'s `base_partitions`, `content.ipp.yml`'s `disk_yaml` partition table, `image.ipp.yml`'s `mkfs.fat` stage and mount/copy device map) lives inside the disk-image-building `image` pipeline, which neither export path exercises (`aib build --tar` never requests a disk output; the gate boots the ext4 export directly via `-kernel`; the board netboots the BSP kernel) — so this only removes an unused disk-image code path, not rootfs content. `use_ukiboot` stays at its default (true); nothing it gates depends on `use_efipart`. **Kept the fstab neutralization too** — the image's fstab genuinely was written for a disk image, and it keeps the gate and board paths symmetric — just don't credit it with fixing this particular loop; a different root cause was hiding behind it. Also hardened `qemu-gate.exp` with a boot-loop guard: it counts `Booting Linux on physical CPU` (the kernel's first boot line, printed once per boot) and fails fast with a distinct diagnostic on the third occurrence, instead of waiting out the full 1800 s budget to notice a loop that was obvious by the second boot — this cost ~2.5 minutes to diagnose the `boot-efi.mount` cause above, instead of 30. |
| `GATE1_SYSTEMD_STATE=degraded`, with exactly two failed units: `selinux-bools.service` and `ukiboot-set-success.service` | Both expected on this gate/kernel combination, not a bug. `selinux-bools.service` (`[FAILED] Failed to start selinux-bools.service - Enable selinux booleans.`) fails because the BSP-mimic kernel has no `CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX`, so `setsebool` has nothing to operate on — itself a real survey answer about running AutoSD userspace on the BSP kernel. `ukiboot-set-success.service` (`"Mark boot as successful in ukibootctl partition"`) fails because `use_efipart: false` (see the `boot-efi.mount` row above) means there is no ukibootctl partition for it to write to. Neither causes the earlier reboot loop — that was `emergency.service` reacting to the (now-fixed) `boot-efi.mount` failure, not either of these two units; they just appear adjacent to it in the console log and are easy to conflate with it. | None needed; recorded here so `degraded` doesn't alarm the board operator and these two failed units aren't mistaken for a live problem. |
| `GATE3_FAIL` / `GATE4_FAIL` with `Error: ... dial tcp [::1]:443: connect: connection refused` (pinging a registry literally named `localhost`), even though the console shows `Loaded image: docker.io/library/x5h-captest:latest` immediately above it | `gate-guest.sh` hardcoded the loaded captest image as `localhost/x5h-captest:latest`, matching what `podman load` produced on the dev host Task 4 was reviewed on. This guest's podman normalizes the same tar to `docker.io/library/x5h-captest:latest` instead — tag normalization on `load` differs across podman builds/versions, so it was never safe to hardcode. The subsequent `podman run --rm localhost/x5h-captest:latest ...` found no local image and tried to pull from a registry named `localhost`. Separately, `GATE2_EXT4_UNEXPECTED_PASS` rested on `podman load`'s exit status alone, unlike GATE3/GATE4's `load` **+** `getcap` check — a `load` that silently dropped the capability xattr would still have reported a "pass". | `gate-guest.sh` now discovers the loaded tag via `podman images` in all three of GATE2/GATE3/GATE4 (the same pattern GATE5 already used for busybox), guarding against an empty capture before ever calling `podman run`. GATE2 now also runs the same `run` + `getcap` check GATE3/GATE4 have, so `GATE2_EXT4_UNEXPECTED_PASS` requires the capability to actually be readable in a running container, not just a `load` that exited 0 — a `load`-succeeds-but-`getcap`-fails outcome now reports `GATE2_EXT4_FAIL_OK` instead, since that is still the constraint manifesting, just silently. |
| Console shows `Error: netavark: Must provide a valid firewall backend, got iptables` right after GATE5's first attempt, then the fallback path succeeds and `GATE5_NONE_OK` prints | This image resolves **netavark 2.0.0**. CentOS Stream 10's AppStream repo also carries netavark 1.16.0 and 1.17.2, which still had an `"iptables"` firewall backend (confirmed against `containers/netavark`'s own `src/firewall/mod.rs` at each of those git tags) — but 2.0.0 removed it; only `"firewalld"`, `"nftables"`, and `"none"` are recognized `firewall_driver` values in this netavark, and `"iptables"` is rejected outright as a config-validation error, regardless of what kernel modules are loaded. Separately, `"nftables"` would not work on this kernel anyway (no `CONFIG_NF_TABLES`), and `"firewalld"` needs a running dbus/firewalld daemon this image does not configure — so `"none"` is the only value both accepted by this netavark and functional here, which GATE5 confirmed empirically (`podman0` bridge up, `veth0` in forwarding, direct-container-IP curl succeeding). | `50-x5h.conf` now ships `firewall_driver = "none"` directly instead of `"iptables"`. Reasoning: the board runs this same config and has no gate-side fallback — `board-podman-smoke.sh` only prints a hint for the operator to retry manually on a network failure, it does not auto-retry — so shipping a value this netavark rejects would burn time in the one-shot board session on a failure already known in advance. Regression detection survives no longer shipping `"iptables"`: GATE5's own two-stage structure (try a port-published container, then the direct-IP fallback) actively probes real networking behavior regardless of the starting config, so a future regression in the `none`-driver path itself still shows up as `GATE5_FAIL`. What is no longer independently re-confirmed on every run is specifically whether this netavark still rejects the string `"iptables"` — now a documented, version-pinned fact instead of a per-run probe; it would only need revisiting if the resolved netavark package version itself changes. |
