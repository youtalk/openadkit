# Build the X5H kernel: the board's own 6.1.102 BSP source with the
# AutoSD-alignment + QEMU-gate fragments merged over the board-extracted
# config, compiled with the PINNED ARM GNU 13.2.Rel1 x86_64-hosted cross
# toolchain.
#
# Why pinned: the 2026-08-05 board session root-caused the rebuilt
# kernel's 0.09s hang to a layout-sensitive platform bug that wedges one
# secondary CPU at SMP bringup. With this exact config, GCC 13.2 booted
# 3/3 distinct layouts and GCC 13.3 wedged 3/3. The pin is EMPIRICAL, not
# a guarantee -- the board smoke stays the final arbiter for any kernel
# change (the QEMU gate cannot see this defect class). ARM ships no
# aarch64-hosted 13.2.Rel1 aarch64-none-linux-gnu toolchain (404 on both
# mirrors, verified 2026-08-05), hence x86_64 cross everywhere, CI
# included. An environment-dependent compiler fallback is exactly the
# path by which this bug returns: none is offered.
#
# Modes:
#   (default)         full build, fw-less gate image (CI / QEMU gate)
#   --firmware <dir>  full build, board image embedding rcar_gen5_mp_phy.bin
#                     from <dir> (REQUIRED for TSN netboot; NDA SDK blob --
#                     local builds only, never CI)
#   --config-only     config merge + asserts only, no compile -- but the
#                     pinned toolchain is still fetched first (Kconfig
#                     evaluates $(CC) even for config targets, and the
#                     emitted config's CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT must name the
#                     compiler that will build the Image), so this mode also
#                     needs an x86_64 host
#   --toolchain-only  fetch/verify/assert the toolchain, then exit
# Usage: build-bsp-kernel.sh [--config-only|--toolchain-only] [--firmware <dir>] <outdir>
# Produces in <outdir>: Image-autosd, r8a78000-ironhide-uio-autosd.dtb,

# Path-independent build-ids, so the reproducibility promise above holds
# across build DIRECTORIES and not just across machines. The two embedded
# vDSOs and every module are linked with --build-id=sha1, and a build-id
# hashes the debug info, which records the absolute build directory in
# DW_AT_comp_dir. Building the same source under two different absolute
# paths therefore produced artifacts differing ONLY in those notes
# (measured: 40 bytes in Image-autosd, exactly 20 -- one NT_GNU_BUILD_ID --
# per .ko, 972/975 files in the tar); stripping removes the debug info but
# keeps the note, so INSTALL_MOD_STRIP does not hide it.
# Documentation/kbuild/reproducible-builds.rst prescribes exactly this map.
# -fdebug-prefix-map, NOT -ffile-prefix-map: the latter also rewrites
# __FILE__, changing .rodata contents and potentially shifting code layout
# -- and this board's SMP wedge (see the header) is layout-sensitive, with
# functionally identical kernels landing on opposite sides of it. Nothing
# here may move code; -fdebug-prefix-map affects debug info only.
#
# BOTH KCFLAGS and KAFLAGS: the kernel's top-level Makefile feeds KCFLAGS
# into KBUILD_CFLAGS and KAFLAGS into KBUILD_AFLAGS as two separate
# variables, so KCFLAGS alone leaves every .S-built object untouched.
# Measured, not assumed: KCFLAGS alone took the module tar from 972 of 975
# files differing down to 8, and all 8 survivors were arch/arm64/crypto
# modules whose C halves matched byte for byte while their .S halves did
# not (sha3-ce-glue.o same, sha3-ce-core.o differing) -- with the Image
# still differing in the two vDSOs, which are likewise part C part .S. gcc
# forwards -fdebug-prefix-map to gas as --debug-prefix-map for .S input,
# so the assembler's DWARF directory is remapped the same way; confirmed
# against the pinned 13.2.Rel1 binutils in isolation. Appended to any
# caller-supplied value rather than replacing it.
#
# $TOOLDIR is mapped as well as $SRC, because two objects' compile flags name
# the TOOLCHAIN's absolute path rather than the source tree's. Both use the
# same idiom, which exists to make <arm_neon.h> reachable from a
# -ffreestanding kernel build:
#   arch/arm64/lib/Makefile:13
#     CFLAGS_xor-neon.o += -isystem $(shell $(CC) -print-file-name=include)
#   lib/raid6/Makefile:40  (NEON_FLAGS, applied to recov_neon_inner.o)
#     NEON_FLAGS        += -isystem $(shell $(CC) -print-file-name=include)
# That expands to $TOOLDIR/<toolchain>/lib/gcc/.../include, which lands in
# the DWARF directory table of xor-neon.o and recov_neon_inner.o and hence
# in the NT_GNU_BUILD_ID of xor-neon.ko and raid6_pq.ko -- which were exactly
# the two modules of 972 that still differed between a local build under
# /home/youtalk/.cache/x5h-toolchain and a CI build under
# /home/runner/.cache/x5h-toolchain, 20 bytes each. Measured after adding
# this map: the directory entry reads /x5h/toolchain/..., those two build-ids
# moved, and Image, dtb and the other 973 tar members stayed byte-identical.
# crypto/Makefile:126 uses the same idiom for aegis128-neon-inner.o; this
# config does not build it (CONFIG_CRYPTO_AEGIS128 is not set), but the same
# map would cover it. Both maps go into both variables.
#
# raid6_pq.ko is NOT the $(AWK)/unroll.awk problem an earlier reading took it
# for (lib/raid6/Makefile:55 generates int{1,2,4,8,16,32}.c). Checked here:
# mawk 1.3.4 and busybox awk emit byte-identical int*.c, and the generated
# sources carry no host or path string. The toolchain include path above
# accounts for it. Cross-host identity of raid6_pq.ko is therefore EXPECTED
# but not yet proven -- it needs one CI artifact built with this map to
# confirm, since every local build here shares one $TOOLDIR value.
