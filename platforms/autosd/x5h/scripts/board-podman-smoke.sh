# ext4loop is also zero-mutation (backing file on /run tmpfs) and runs
# between them on the rebuilt kernel. This is enforced, not just
# documented: a genuine tmpfs pass stamps TMPFS_STAMP below, and the btrfs
# arm refuses to run without it. The tmpfs->btrfs interlock stamp is

# Clear the transient store's runroot before any podman call. This is not
# hygiene, it is required on the board: AutoSD ships
# /usr/share/containers/storage.conf with transient_store = true, so the
# storage database lives in the runroot (/run/containers/storage) rather
# than under the graphroot. podman-clean-transient.service runs at boot,
# long before this script mounts anything, and at that moment
# /var/lib/containers is still the NFS root -- where overlay is refused
# outright ("'overlay' is not supported over nfs"). The unit fails, but it
# has already written db.sql + overlay/ into the runroot recording that
# verdict, and every later podman invocation in the same boot reuses it --
# so podman keeps reporting the store as NFS even once a tmpfs or btrfs
# store IS mounted over /var/lib/containers and stat -f confirms it. That
# reproduced exactly on the board: SMOKE_tmpfs_STORE_FS=tmpfs immediately
# followed by SMOKE_tmpfs_LOAD_FAIL with the nfs message, while the same
# load against a fresh --root/--runroot pair succeeded. Removing this
# directory is safe by construction -- it is transient state on /run that
# containers/storage recreates on demand -- and it is also wanted BETWEEN
# phases, since each phase mounts a different store underneath a database
# that would otherwise still describe the previous one.
