# reach the image (see uio.md), not a device-tree fault.

# --- layer 3.5: the kernel is still intact ------------------------------
# Measured 2026-08-21: a run can print correct latencies on a kernel that has
# already oopsed, so a plausible number is not evidence of a healthy board.
# Two oops sources are known here, and both are worth naming rather than
# reporting as "it crashed":
#   * rcar_gen5_rproc_prepare -> of_reserved_mem_lookup, when the booted dtb
#     describes the realtime cores but not their reserved memory (the vendor
#     NPU dtb does exactly that). Stop whatever starts the realtime core.
#   * an undefined-instruction fault during model load, which takes printk
#     with it and leaves the board needing a power cycle.
# Refuse to measure on a damaged kernel; the numbers would not mean anything.

# --- layer 4: contiguous memory ----------------------------------------
# cmem0 comes from the default CMA and proves only that the module loaded.
# The runtime wants cmem_other*, which exist one per phandle in /cmem's
# memory-region list -- so their absence is a device-tree gap, not a module
# argument to tune (npu-bringup.md).

# A *short count* is the trap, not a zero count. /cmem's memory-region list is
# one 4-byte phandle per region, so the expected number is knowable; and when
# one region short-changes you, the runtime fails at "Failed to open device
# /dev/cmem_otherN" -- which points at the driver, not at the real cause.
#
# The real cause, measured 2026-08-21: U-Boot's default kernel_addr_r places
# the kernel INSIDE one of the npu_region ranges. Those regions are declared
# reusable, so Linux boots and looks healthy, but cmem's whole-region
# allocation then returns -EBUSY for that one region. Load the kernel outside
# every npu_region and all of them allocate.

# --- layer 6: the execution provider actually ran ------------------------
# A run that merely completes proves nothing, in two separate ways. The sample
# script lists CPUExecutionProvider as a fallback, so a board with no NPU still
# produces correct results and a latency figure; and its run_inference()
# swallows every exception into a printed "Error occurred:" line and returns
# normally, so the exit status is 0 even when nothing ran. Hence three
# assertions on the output text rather than one on $?.
#
# What this does not prove is which subgraphs the NPU executed -- the provider
# list only says the EP registered. The ORT profiler (--enable-rtt) carries the
# per-node assignment; check it by hand the first time the NPU comes up, and
# turn it into an assertion here once its schema is known rather than guessed.
